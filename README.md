# Welcome to the lebchen.rocks repo

This repository hosts the code for '[lebchen.rocks](https://lebchen.rocks)' my Synthwave artist page. Built with Astro and powered by Static Site Generation (SSG), the site is designed to give fans a fast and immersive experience that reflects the retro-futuristic vibe of my music. The goal was to create a lightweight, accessible page that complements the sound and aesthetic of lebchen. Feel free to explore the code and see how everything comes together. Thanks for checking it out!
